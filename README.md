# Cub3D


This project creates an environment for a 3D game entirely in C which renders a 3D maze using RayCasting 
and the "DDA" algorithm written entirely by me and my collaborator: Luigi Argenziano Vagello (https://github.com/itrustinshell), 
similar to how the iconic Wolfenstein 3D was made, one of the first PC FPS games that popularized the genre.
